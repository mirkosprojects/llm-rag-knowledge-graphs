Extremophile archaea inhabiting subglacial Antarctic lakes, such as Lake Vostok and Lake Whillans, have evolved unique metabolic strategies to survive in cold, high-pressure, anoxic environments isolated from the surface for millions of years. These archaea rely on chemolithoautotrophy, oxidizing reduced minerals like ferrous iron or ammonium to generate energy in the absence of sunlight. Their membranes contain unusual ether lipids that maintain fluidity at subzero temperatures, and their enzymes remain active despite the extreme cold and high salinity. These adaptations not only reveal the limits of life on Earth but also inform astrobiological research, as similar conditions may exist on icy moons like Europa and Enceladus.
