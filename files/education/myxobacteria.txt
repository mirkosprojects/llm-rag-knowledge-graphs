Myxobacteria, a group of Gram-negative delta-proteobacteria, play a critical role in soil nutrient cycling due to their unique ability to degrade complex polymers such as cellulose and chitin. Unlike many other bacteria, myxobacteria exhibit cooperative swarming and form multicellular fruiting bodies when nutrients are scarce. These structures enable sporulation and survival during adverse conditions. Their predatory behavior involves the secretion of lytic enzymes that break down neighboring microbial cells, effectively recycling nutrients back into the soil matrix. This process enhances soil fertility and influences microbial community dynamics, although the specific biochemical pathways used by myxobacteria in polysaccharide degradation remain an active area of research.
